    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat the oven to 190C/fan170C/gas 5 and line two baking sheets with non-stick baking paper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a bowl and beat until creamy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 large egg.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sift 225g plain flour, ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda and ¼ tsp salt into the bowl and mix it in with a wooden spoon.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake for 8–10 mins until they are light brown on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.
        </li>
        <li>
            Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set and then lift onto a cooling rack.
        </li>
    </ol>
