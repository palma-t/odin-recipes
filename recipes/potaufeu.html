        <li>2 leaves bay</li>
        <li>2 small potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a medium pot over medium heat. Sauté onion and garlic until translucent.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the beef (and bone) to the pot, along with enough water to cover the beef - about 3 cups of water. Add the salt and pepper. Cover the pot with a lid and bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low (erring on the side of low).
        </li>
        <li>
            After 30 minutes, add the carrots and bay leaves.
        </li>
        <li>
            After another hour, check the beef with a fork to check if it’s tender yet. If not, continue cooking and checking the beef in 10 minute increments.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the bay leaves and serve the stew with some crusty French bread.
        </li>
    </ol>
