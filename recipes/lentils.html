    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound dry lentils, rinsed</li>
        <li>1 cube chicken bouillon</li>
        <li>2 cups water, or as needed to cover lentils by 2 inches</li>
        <li>6 slices bacon</li>
        <li>½ pound Mexican chorizo, casing removed and meat crumbled</li>
        <li>1 Roma (plum) tomato, diced</li>
        <li>1 small white onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon cumin</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place rinsed lentils into a large pot. Add bouillon cube and pour in enough water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a simmer, then cook until lentils are just tender, about 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chorizo and cook, stirring occasionally, until brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add bacon to the skillet and lightly fry until cooked but still soft, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and chop; leave drippings in the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook tomato, tomatillo, onion, and garlic in bacon drippings until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup water and cilantro; transfer mixture to a blender. Holding the lid of the blender down with a folded kitchen towel, carefully start the blender; use a few quick pulses to get the mixture moving, then leave it on to purée until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the puréed vegetables, chorizo, bacon, and cumin to the lentil-broth mixture. Cook and stir over medium heat until hot, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Ladle soup into bowls.</li>
